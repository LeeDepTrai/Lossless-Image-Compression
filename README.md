# Lossless-Image-Compression
This repo performs some lossless algorithms.
List files:
  1. ShannonFano.py: encode and decode pictures with .bmp and .tuff format (24-bit color)  
  2. Huffman.py: the same Shannon-Fano
  3. lzw.py: 
  4. Athmetic.py: encode and decode a very short random list of number. 
  5. demo.py: used to run all algorithm.
